Problem 1
10.0/10.0 points (graded)
Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string s. Valid vowels are: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', your program should print:
# Paste your code into this box 
# variable s is predefined
# define and set variable vowelCount to 0
vowelCount = 0
# create a for loop to iterate through each character of s
for letter in s:
    # if letter in s equal to each vowel, increment vowelCount by 1
    if letter == "a":
        vowelCount += 1
    elif letter == "e":
        vowelCount += 1
    elif letter == "i":
        vowelCount += 1
    elif letter == "o":
        vowelCount += 1
    elif letter == "u":
        vowelCount += 1
# print the concatenated first string and vowelCount
print("Number of vowels: " + str(vowelCount))
 Problem 2
10.0/10.0 points (graded)
Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the number of times the string 'bob' occurs in s. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print
# Paste your code into this box 
# s is a predefined string
# define and set bobCount to 0
bobCount = 0
# iterate through the range from 0 to the length of s
for i in range(len(s)):
  # check to see if the substring accessed is equal to 'bob'
  if (s[i:i+3] == 'bob'):
      bobCount += 1
print("Number of times bob occurs is: " + str(bobCount))
Problem 3
15.0/15.0 points (graded)
Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print

Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh
In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if s = 'abcbcd', then your program should print

Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc
Note: This problem may be challenging. We encourage you to work smart. If you've spent more than a few hours on this problem, we suggest that you move on to a different part of the course. If you have time, come back to this problem after you've had a break and cleared your head.
# Paste your code into this box 
current = ''
longest = ''
for i in range(len(s)):
 if (s[i] >= s[i-1]):
  current += s[i]
 else:
  current = s[i]
 if len(current) > len(longest):
  longest = current
print("Longest substring in alphabetical order is: " + longest)
