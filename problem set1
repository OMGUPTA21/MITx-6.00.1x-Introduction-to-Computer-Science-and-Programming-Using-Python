Problem 1
10.0/10.0 points (graded)
Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string s. Valid vowels are: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', your program should print:
# Paste your code into this box 
# variable s is predefined
# define and set variable vowelCount to 0
vowelCount = 0
# create a for loop to iterate through each character of s
for letter in s:
    # if letter in s equal to each vowel, increment vowelCount by 1
    if letter == "a":
        vowelCount += 1
    elif letter == "e":
        vowelCount += 1
    elif letter == "i":
        vowelCount += 1
    elif letter == "o":
        vowelCount += 1
    elif letter == "u":
        vowelCount += 1
# print the concatenated first string and vowelCount
print("Number of vowels: " + str(vowelCount))
