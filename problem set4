Problem 1 - Word Scores
10.0/10.0 points (graded)
The first step is to implement some code that allows us to calculate the score for a single word. The function getWordScore should accept as input a string of lowercase letters (a word) and return the integer score for that word, using the game's scoring rules.

A Reminder of the Scoring Rules

Hints
You may assume that the input word is always either a string of lowercase letters, or the empty string "".
You will want to use the SCRABBLE_LETTER_VALUES dictionary defined at the top of ps4a.py. You should not change its value.
Do not assume that there are always 7 letters in a hand! The parameter n is the number of letters required for a bonus score (the maximum number of letters in the hand). Our goal is to keep the code modular - if you want to try playing your word game with n=10 or n=4, you will be able to do it by simply changing the value of HAND_SIZE!
Testing: If this function is implemented properly, and you run test_ps4a.py, you should see that the test_getWordScore() tests pass. Also test your implementation of getWordScore, using some reasonable English words.
Fill in the code for getWordScore in ps4a.py and be sure you've passed the appropriate tests in test_ps4a.py before pasting your function definition here.

    Problem 2 - Dealing with Hands
10.0/10.0 points (graded)
**Please read this problem entirely!!** The majority of this problem consists of learning how to read code, which is an incredibly useful and important skill. At the end, you will implement a short function. Be sure to take your time on this problem - it may seem easy, but reading someone else's code can be challenging and this is an important exercise.

def updateHand(hand, word):
    """
    Assumes that 'hand' has all the letters in word.
    In other words, this assumes that however many times
    a letter appears in 'word', 'hand' has at least as
    many of that letter in it. 
    Updates the hand: uses up the letters in the given word
    and returns the new hand, without those letters in it.
    Has no side effects: does not modify hand.
    word: string
    hand: dictionary (string -> int)    
    returns: dictionary (string -> int)
    """
    # TO DO ... <-- Remove this comment when you code this function
    output = hand.copy()
    for letter in word:
        if letter in output.keys():
            output[letter] -= 1
    return output
    Completed
Problem 3 - Valid Words
10.0/10.0 points (graded)
At this point, we have written code to generate a random hand and display that hand to the user. We can also ask the user for a word (Python's input) and score the word (using your getWordScore). However, at this point we have not written any code to verify that a word given by a player obeys the rules of the game. A valid word is in the word list; and it is composed entirely of letters from the current hand. Implement the isValidWord function.

Testing: Make sure the test_isValidWord tests pass. In addition, you will want to test your implementation by calling it multiple times on the same hand - what should the correct behavior be? Additionally, the empty string ('') is not a valid word - if you code this function correctly, you shouldn't need an additional check for this condition.

Fill in the code for isValidWord in ps4a.py and be sure you've passed the appropriate tests in test_ps4a.py before pasting your function definition here.

def isValidWord(word, hand, wordList):
    """
    Returns True if word is in the wordList and is entirely
    composed of letters in the hand. Otherwise, returns False.
 
    Does not mutate hand or wordList.

    word_check = False
    if word in wordList:
        word_check = True
 
    letter_check = set(list(word)) <= set(output.keys())
 
    for letter in word:
        if letter in output.keys():
            output[letter] -= 1

Problem 4 - Hand Length

We are now ready to begin writing the code that interacts with the player. We'll be implementing the playHand function. This function allows the user to play out a single hand. First, though, you'll need to implement the helper calculateHandlen function, which can be done in under five lines of code.

Problem 5 - Playing a Hand

In ps4a.py, note that in the function playHand, there is a bunch of pseudocode. This pseudocode is provided to help guide you in writing your function. Check out the Why Pseudocode? resource to learn more about the What and Why of Pseudocode before you start coding your solution.

Note: Do not assume that there will always be 7 letters in a hand! The parameter n represents the size of the hand.

Testing: Before testing your code in the answer box, try out your implementation as if you were playing the game. Here is some example output of playHand:

Problem 6 - Playing a Game
15.0/15.0 points (graded)
A game consists of playing multiple hands. We need to implement one final function to complete our word-game program. Write the code that implements the playGame function. You should remove the code that is currently uncommented in the playGame body. Read through the specification and make sure you understand what this function accomplishes. For the game, you should use the HAND_SIZE constant to determine the number of cards in a hand.

Testing: Try out this implementation as if you were playing the game. Try out different values for HAND_SIZE with your program, and be sure that you can play the wordgame with different hand sizes by modifying only the variable HAND_SIZE.
