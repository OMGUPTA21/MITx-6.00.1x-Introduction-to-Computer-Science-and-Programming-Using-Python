 Problem 5

You have 2 attempts for this problem.

Here is code for linear search that uses the fact that a set of elements is sorted in increasing order:

def search(L, e):
    for i in range(len(L)):
        if L[i] == e:
            return True
        if L[i] > e:
            return False
    return False
 
    
Consider the following code, which is an alternative version of search.

def newsearch(L, e):
    size = len(L)
    for i in range(size):
        if L[size-i-1] == e:
            return True
        if L[i] < e:
            return False
    return False

    
Which of the following statements is correct? You may assume that each function is tested with a list L whose elements are sorted in increasing order; for simplicity, assume L is a list of positive integers.


search and newsearch return the same answers for all L and e.
search and newsearch return the same answers provided L is non-empty.
search and newsearch return the same answers provided L is non-empty and e is in L.
search and newsearch never return the same answers.
search and newsearch return the same answers for lists L of length 0, 1, or 2.*
search and newsearch return the same answers for lists L of length 0 or 1.

Answer the questions below based on the following sorting function. If it helps, you may paste the code in your programming environment. Study the output to make sure you understand the way it sorts.

def swapSort(L): 
    """ L is a list on integers """
    print("Original L: ", L)
    for i in range(len(L)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(L)):
            if L[j] < L[i]:
                # the next line is a short 
                # form for swap L[i] and L[j]
                L[j], L[i] = L[i], L[j] 
                print(L)
    print("Final L: ", L)
    
Does this function sort the list in increasing or decreasing order? (items at lower indices being smaller means it sorts in increasing order, and vice versa)

If we make a small change to the line for j in range(i+1, len(L)): such that the code becomes:

def modSwapSort(L): 
    """ L is a list on integers """
    print("Original L: ", L)
    for i in range(len(L)):
        for j in range(len(L)):
            if L[j] < L[i]:
                # the next line is a short 
                # form for swap L[i] and L[j]
                L[j], L[i] = L[i], L[j] 
                print(L)
    print("Final L: ", L)
    
What happens to the behavior of swapSort with this new code?


No change
modSwapSort now orders the list in descending order for all lists.*
modSwapSort now orders the list in descending order for SOME lists but not all
modSwapSort enters an infinite loop.
